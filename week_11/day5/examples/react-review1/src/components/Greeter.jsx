import React, { useState } from 'react'

export default function Greeter() {
  //* Set initial state
  //? Notice the use of square brackets when state variable is declared. This is the ES6 array destructuring syntax, and it means weâ€™re assigning the first element of the array returned by useState to name and the second element to setName variable. So this means we have a state named name and we can update it by calling on setName() function.

  //* Grabs value of the input field and changes the initial state to whatever is typed in the input field.
